Html notes

Html - Hypertext markup language

Https - Hypertext transfer protocol

DNS - Domain Name Server

IP address - location of a directory on the internet/server

Browser - App used to view files pulled from IP address

How it all flows:

A browsers sends a request to find an IP inside of the DNS. The DNS confirms the IP/domain name and pulls the files into the browser using https.
