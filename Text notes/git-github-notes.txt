Homebrew install also req.
Git config options for credit need to be set

Quick git Reference
 
First Push for a Project/Lab

git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin PASTE_YOUR_URL
git push -u origin master

 
Completed a Lab Step or Made Some Changes

git add .
git commit -m "completing lab step 2"
git push

These are simply repeated for each lab step you complete, or just pushing your final lab code to GitHub.
 
Repetition

And remember this process is repeated for each new lab or project folder you make. NOT SUBFOLDERS OF THE SAME PROJECT.


Password sign in for Mac = Homebrew + brew install gh

NEED to learn:
How to change repository
Cleaning commit log after files attempts
	- use git reset HEAD~ "number of get you are "Ahead" in when viewing git status"
	- also check out GIT LFS : brew install git-lfs - check with git lefs install = git lfs initialized
