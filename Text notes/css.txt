CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
Hint - we can add mutiply classes and elements to a CCS rule set

        RGB(000,250,000);
        rgba:(000,250,000,.50) - alpha acts as transprancy

    Layouts:
        Display: 
            None - makes things hidden ( Javascript )
            block - They take up a whole width of the section ( they stack up )
            inline - they line up inline mutiple through a block ( they get in line )
            inline block - respect inline width and height properties of this element in this block
    
    Positioning
        position:
            Static - default, block stacking, no top bottom, left right options
            relative - no direct change, need to apply top bottom left right terms
            absolute - removes an element from from the overal static flow and makes its container the the parent it is in
            fixed - fixes the item to the view port, used for navbars
            float: - default is to
                left, right, clear: both ( fixs item that have overlap floating errors)
